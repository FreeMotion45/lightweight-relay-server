# lightweight-relay-server
A super lightweight lobby relay server.

I made this purely for the purpose of testing my game against a relay server.
If anyone ever needs this, you are welcome to use this.

There are no dependencies. All you have to do is start Program.cs inside LightWeightServer and you are good to go.
There is some example junk which you can just delete. As long as you got your server there running you are all good.
