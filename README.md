# lightweight-relay-server
A super lightweight lobby relay server.

I made this purely for the purpose of testing my game against a relay server.
If anyone ever needs this, you are welcome to use this.

There are no dependencies. All you have to do is start Program.cs inside LightWeightServer and you are good to go.
There is some example junk which you can just delete. As long as you got your server there running you are all good.

# Commands
Only the most simple and basics commands are supported: Join, Leave, Create, Relay.

Note that because the server is ultra simple, I did't implement any command verification. This means
that lobbies can be overriden. However, I find this more than enough for simply testing purposes.
Feel free to make a Pull Request if you want to.

I know I am the only one who's going to ever look at this, but who knows.
